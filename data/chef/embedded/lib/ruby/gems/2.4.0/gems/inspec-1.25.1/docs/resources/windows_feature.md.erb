# windows_feature

Use the `windows_feature` InSpec audit resource to test features on Windows via the `Get-WindowsFeature` cmdlet.

## Syntax

A `windows_feature` resource block declares the name of the Windows feature, tests if that feature is installed, and then returns information about that feature:

    describe windows_feature('feature_name') do
      it { should be_installed }
    end

where

* `('feature_name')` must specify a Windows feature name, such as `DHCP Server` or `IIS-Webserver`
* `be_installed` is a valid matcher for this resource


## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following matchers:

### be

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_be" %>

### be_installed

The `be_installed` matcher tests if the named Windows feature is installed:

    it { should be_installed }

### cmp

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_cmp" %>

### eq

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_eq" %>

### include

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_include" %>

### match

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_match" %>

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this InSpec audit resource.

### Test the DHCP Server feature

    describe windows_feature('DHCP Server') do
      it{ should be_installed }
    end
