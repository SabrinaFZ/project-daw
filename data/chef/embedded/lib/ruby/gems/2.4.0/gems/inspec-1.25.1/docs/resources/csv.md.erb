# csv

Use the `csv` InSpec audit resource to test configuration data in a CSV file.

## Syntax

A `csv` resource block declares the configuration data to be tested:

    describe csv('file') do
      its('name') { should eq 'foo' }
    end

where

* `'file'` is the path to a CSV file
* `name` is a configuration setting in a CSV file
* `should eq 'foo'` tests a value of `name` as read from a CSV file versus the value declared in the test
