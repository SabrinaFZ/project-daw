# npm

Use the `npm` InSpec audit resource to test if a global NPM package is installed. NPM is the the package manager for Node.js packages (https://docs.npmjs.com), such as Bower and StatsD.


## Syntax

A `npm` resource block declares a package and (optionally) a package version:

    describe npm('npm_package_name') do
      it { should be_installed }
    end

where

* `('npm_package_name')` must specify an NPM package, such as `'bower'` or `'statsd'`
* `be_installed` is a valid matcher for this resource


## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following matchers:

### be

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_be" %>

### be_installed

The `be_installed` matcher tests if the named Gem package and package version (if specified) is installed:

    it { should be_installed }

### cmp

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_cmp" %>

### eq

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_eq" %>

### include

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_include" %>

### match

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_match" %>

### version

The `version` matcher tests if the named package version is on the system:

    its('version') { should eq '1.2.3' }

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this InSpec audit resource.

### Verify that bower is installed, with a specific version

    describe npm('bower') do
      it { should be_installed }
      its('version') { should eq '1.4.1' }
    end

### Verify that statsd is not installed

    describe npm('statsd') do
      it { should_not be_installed }
    end
