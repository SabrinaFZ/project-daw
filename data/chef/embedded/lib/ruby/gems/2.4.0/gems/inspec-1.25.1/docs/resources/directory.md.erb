title: About the directory Resource

# directory

Use the `directory` InSpec audit resource to test if the file type is a directory. This is equivalent to using the `file` resource and the `be_directory` matcher, but provides a simpler and more direct way to test directories. All of the matchers available to `file` may be used with `directory`.

## Syntax

A `directory` resource block declares the location of the directory to be tested, and then one (or more) matchers:

    describe directory('path') do
      it { should MATCHER 'value' }
    end

## Matchers

This resource may use any of the matchers available to the `file` resource that may be useful when testing a directory.

### be

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_be" %>

### cmp

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_cmp" %>

### eq

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_eq" %>

### include

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_include" %>

### match

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_match" %>

## Examples

None.
