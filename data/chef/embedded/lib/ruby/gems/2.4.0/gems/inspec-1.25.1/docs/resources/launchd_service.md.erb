# launchd_service

Use the ``launchd_service`` InSpec audit resource to test a service using Launchd.

## Syntax

A ``launchd_service`` resource block declares the name of a service and then one (or more) matchers to test the state of the service:

    describe launchd_service('service_name') do
      it { should be_installed }
      it { should be_enabled }
      it { should be_running }
    end

where

* ``('service_name')`` must specify a service name
* `be_installed`, `be_enabled`, and `be_running` are valid matchers for this resource; all matchers available to the `service` resource may be used

The path to the service manager's control may be specified for situations where the path isn't available in the current ``PATH``. For example:

    describe launchd_service('service_name', '/path/to/control') do
      it { should be_enabled }
      it { should be_installed }
      it { should be_running }
    end

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following matchers:

### be

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_be" %>

### be_enabled

The `be_enabled` matcher tests if the named service is enabled:

    it { should be_enabled }

### be_installed

The `be_installed` matcher tests if the named service is installed:

    it { should be_installed }

### be_running

The `be_running` matcher tests if the named service is running:

    it { should be_running }

### cmp

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_cmp" %>

### eq

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_eq" %>

### include

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_include" %>

### match

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_match" %>
