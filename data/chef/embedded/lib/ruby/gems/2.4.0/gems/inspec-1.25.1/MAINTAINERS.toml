This file lists how the InSpec project is maintained. When making changes to the
system, this file tells you who needs to review your patch - you need at least
two maintainers to provide a :+1: on your pull request. Additionally, you need
to not receive a veto from a Lieutenant or the Project Lead.
Check out [How Chef is Maintained](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc030-maintenance-policy.md#how-the-project-is-maintained)
for details on the process, how to become a maintainer, lieutenant, or the
project lead.
