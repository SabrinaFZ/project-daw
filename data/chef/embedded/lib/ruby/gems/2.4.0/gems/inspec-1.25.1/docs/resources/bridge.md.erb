title: About the bridge Resource

# bridge

Use the `bridge` InSpec audit resource to test basic network bridge properties, such as name, if an interface is defined, and the associations for any defined interface.

* On Linux platforms, any value in the `/sys/class/net/{interface}/bridge` directory may be tested
* On the Windows platform, the `Get-NetAdapter` cmdlet is associated with the `Get-NetAdapterBinding` cmdlet and returns the `ComponentID ms_bridge` value as a JSON object

## Syntax

A `bridge` resource block declares the bridge to be tested and what interface it should be associated with:

    describe bridge('br0') do
      it { should exist }
      it { should have_interface 'eth0' }
    end

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following matchers:

### be

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_be" %>

### cmp

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_cmp" %>

### eq

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_eq" %>

### exist

The `exist` matcher tests if the network bridge is available:

    it { should exist }

### have_interface

The `have_interface` matcher tests if the named interface is defined for the network bridge:

    it { should have_interface 'eth0' }

### include

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_include" %>

### interfaces

The `interfaces` matcher tests if the named interface is present:

    its('interfaces') { should eq 'foo' }
    its('interfaces') { should eq 'bar' }
    its('interfaces') { should include('foo') }

### match

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_match" %>
